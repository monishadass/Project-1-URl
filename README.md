# Project Title
Phishing URL Detection System

## Description
The Phishing URL Detection System is a project designed to identify whether a website link is safe or harmful. Phishing is a common online problem where fake websites try to steal personal information such as usernames, passwords, and bank details by pretending to be real websites. This system helps users by checking a given URL and deciding if it is legitimate or a phishing link.

The project works by analyzing different features of a URL and then classifying it as either safe or unsafe. It aims to increase awareness about online security and reduce the risk of falling into phishing attacks. This project is useful for learning basic cybersecurity concepts and understanding how phishing detection systems work in real life.
